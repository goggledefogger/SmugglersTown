Smuggler's Town

### What is this repository for? ###

* Smuggler's Town is multiplayer Capture The Flag on top of Google Maps! It's yellow Town team vs the red Crush team, you must find and grab the smoking golden toilet and return it to your base before someone else gets it or steals it from you!
* 0.1

### How do I get set up? ###

* Written in JavaScript using the Google Maps API
* Comes with a node web server for ease of development, just run the bin/dev script

## Issues

This is a WIP! Known issues:

* Matchmaker: Closing the app doesn't clean up the db, so new users can get stuck in orphaned sessions
* Graphics: Opponents cars don't rotate
* Code is still in transition. I scrapped it together before I knew how to write js, and it's now being transitioned into a better structured, modular way. But it's not done!
